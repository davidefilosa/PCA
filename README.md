# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


When we need to analyze a large dataset with an high number of of dimensions/features we can use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to transform this high dimensional data into lower dimensional data.

One of the reasons we should do this is that if we are trying to gain insight from an analysis, having too many predictors could make things more complicated.

Another problem that PCA helps us solve is the multicollinearity.

Multicollinearity is a statistical concept where several independent variables in a model are correlated. It means that some indipendent variables contain the same information about the dependent variable.

PCA allows us to achieve this combining 2 or more variables into components.
